# Retail Sales Data Analysis 📊

This project was created as part of my first task during the **Data Analytics Internship** at **Brainwave Matrix**.  
The objective was to perform a complete sales analysis for a commercial retail store — from data cleaning to interactive dashboard and final recommendations.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Retail store sales data (customer demographics, product details, transactions, etc.)
- **Tools Used**:  
  - Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Power BI for data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design

## 🧪 Process Followed

1. **Data Cleaning (Python)**
   - Handled missing values  
   - Replaced and corrected invalid entries  
   - Prepared data for reporting and analysis

2. **Data Modeling (Power BI)**
   - Created relationships between tables  
   - Built a custom Calendar table for time-based filtering  
   - Implemented multiple **DAX measures** for KPIs and insights

3. **Dashboard Design**
   - Created an interactive multi-page dashboard:
     - **Revenue Analysis**
     - **Product Insights**
     - **Customer Demographics**

4. **Key Insights**
   - Highest revenue generated by 55–65 age group  
   - Smartphones and Yoga Mats are among the top-selling products
